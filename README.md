between an **`Elixir`** (**`Phoenix`**) web App
and **`Gogs`** (`Git`) server
using the
[`gogs`](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs) package. <br />

# _Why_? ü§∑

As software engineers we are **_always learning_ new things**. <br />
When we learn,
we love having _detailed docs and **examples**_
that explain _exactly_ how to get up-and-running.
**`@dwyl`** we _write_ examples because we want them _ourselves_.
**_Comprehensive_ docs/tutorials**
are a _gift_ to our future selves and teammates. üéÅ 
They allow us to get up-to-speed
or remember what's going on
especially when returning to a project after a while.
We constantly refer back to them 
and update them when required.
If you find them useful, please ‚≠ê the repo to let us know.

# _What_? üí≠

This project is intended as a _barebones_ demonstration
of using
[`gogs`](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs)
in any **`Phoenix`** Web Application.
It's intended to be beginner-friendly
and focus on showcasing _one_ things.

It can be used as the basis for another app
or you can borrow chunks of setup/code.

# _Who_? üë•

This demos is intended for people of all Elixir/Phoenix skill levels.

Following all the steps in this example should take around 10 minutes.
However if you get stuck, please don't suffer in silence!
Get help by opening an issue:
[github.com/dwyl/gogs-demo/issues](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-demo/issues)

<br />

# _How?_ üíª

### 0. Prerequisites üìù 

_Before_ you start,
make sure you have the following installed:

1. `Elixir`: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html <br />
   New to `Elixir`? see: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir
2. `Phoenix`: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html <br />
   New to `Phoenix`? see:
   https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework

<br />

### 1. Create a New `Phoenix` App üÜï 

For this example,
we are creating a _basic_ **`Phoenix`** App
without the live dashboard or mailer (email)
or `Ecto` (Postgres database)
because we don't need those components
in order to showcase the `gogs` package.

```sh
mix phx.new app --no-ecto --no-dashboard --no-mailer
```

When prompted to install dependencies:

```sh
Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]
```

Type `y` and hit the `[Enter]` key to install.

You should see something like this:

```sh
* running mix deps.get
* running cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
* running mix deps.compile
```

#### Checkpoint: Working `Phoenix` App üèÅ 

Change into the directory of your newly created `Phoenix` app

```sh
cd app
```

And start the app:

```sh
mix setup
mix phx.server
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```sh
Generated app app
[info] Running AppWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.9.0 at 127.0.0.1:4000 (http)
[info] Access AppWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000
[debug] Downloading esbuild from https://registry.npmjs.org/esbuild-darwin-64/-/esbuild-darwin-64-0.14.29.tgz
[watch] build finished, watching for changes...
```

That confirms the app is working.

Open your web browser to the URL: http://localhost:4000

You should see the default **`Phoenix`** home page:

So far so good. üëå <br />

### 2. Add `gogs` to `deps` ‚¨áÔ∏è 

Open the 
[`mix.exs`]()
file,
locate the `defp deps do` section and add the following line:

```elixir
{:gogs, "~> 0.6.0"},
```

Once you've saved your `mix.exs` file, 
run: 
```sh
mix deps.get
```

### 3. Setup: Environment Variables üìù

To get the **`gogs`** package working in your **`Phoenix`** App,
you will need 4 environment variables:
[**`.env_sample`**](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs/blob/main/.env_sample)

1. `GOGS_URL` - the domain where your Gogs Server is deployed,
   without the protocol, e.g: `gogs-server.fly.dev`

2. `GOGS_ACCESS_TOKEN` - the REST API Access Token 
See: https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server#connect-via-rest-api-https

3. `GOGS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - absolute path to the `id_rsa` file
  on your `localhost` or `Phoenix` server instance.

4. `GOGS_SSH_PORT` - The TCP port allocated to SSH on your Gogs Server,
   in our case it's: `10022`.

> If you're new to Environment Variables
> Please see: 
> [github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables)

#### Context: `Gogs` Server on Fly.io

In _our_ case our **`Gogs`** Server instance
is deployed to [fly.io](https://fly.io/)
at:
[gogs-server.fly.dev](https://gogs-server.fly.dev/)

To understand how this was deployed, 
please see: 
[github.com/dwyl/gogs-server](https://github.com/dwyl/gogs-server)




### X. _Deploy_ to Fly.io

> Need to document how to deploy the Phoenix App to Fly.io
> Will return to this tomorrow. `#EnoughScreens` for today.
